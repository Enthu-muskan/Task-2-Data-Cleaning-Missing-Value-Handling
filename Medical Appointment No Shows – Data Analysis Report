1. Introduction

The Medical Appointment No Shows dataset contains structured healthcare-related data that records patient appointment details and whether patients attended their scheduled medical visits. The primary objective of this analysis is to assess data quality, identify missing values, and apply appropriate data cleaning techniques to ensure the dataset is reliable and ready for further analysis or predictive modeling.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of multiple features describing patient demographics, appointment scheduling information, and behavioral indicators such as age, gender, appointment dates, and attendance status. The target variable indicates whether a patient failed to show up for their scheduled appointment. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical attributes, making it suitable for demonstrating comprehensive data preprocessing methods.

3. Missing Value Analysis

An initial inspection of the dataset was conducted using missing value detection techniques to identify incomplete or inconsistent records. Although the original dataset contained minimal missing values, additional missing entries were introduced to simulate real-world healthcare data issues such as incomplete patient information or data entry errors. Missing value counts were computed for each feature, and visualization techniques were used to understand the distribution and extent of missingness across the dataset.

4. Data Cleaning and Imputation Strategy

To handle missing values effectively, feature-specific imputation strategies were applied based on data type and statistical properties. Numerical features, such as patient age, were treated using median imputation to reduce sensitivity to outliers and maintain the central tendency of the data. Categorical features, including patient gender, were handled using mode imputation to preserve the most frequent category and ensure consistency. Features with an excessively high proportion of missing values were evaluated and removed when necessary to maintain dataset integrity.

5. Data Validation and Quality Assessment

Following the data cleaning process, the dataset was revalidated to confirm that all missing values were successfully addressed. Post-cleaning validation showed that the dataset contained no null values and retained a consistent structure suitable for further analysis. The cleaning process improved overall data quality, minimized potential bias, and enhanced the reliability of insights derived from the dataset.

6. Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the importance of systematic data cleaning and missing value handling in healthcare datasets. By identifying missing data patterns, applying appropriate imputation techniques, and validating the cleaned dataset, the Medical Appointment No Shows dataset was transformed into a high-quality, analysis-ready resource. The cleaned dataset can now be confidently used for exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and decision-support applications in healthcare analytics.
