House Prices Dataset – Data Analysis Report
1. Introduction

The House Prices Dataset contains structured tabular data related to residential properties, including various numerical and categorical features that influence house prices. The objective of this analysis is to assess data quality, identify missing values, and perform appropriate data cleaning to prepare the dataset for reliable statistical analysis and machine learning modeling.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of multiple features describing property characteristics such as location-related attributes, size-related measurements, and other housing indicators. The target variable represents the house price, while the remaining columns act as explanatory features. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical variables, making it suitable for demonstrating comprehensive data preprocessing techniques.

3. Missing Value Analysis

An initial inspection was performed using missing value detection techniques to identify incomplete records. Several columns were found to contain missing values, which is a common issue in real-world housing data due to inconsistent data collection, unavailable property details, or reporting errors. The extent of missingness varied across features, with some columns having only a small number of missing entries and others showing a relatively higher proportion.

To better understand missing data patterns, missing values were visualized using bar charts. This visualization helped identify which features required imputation and which could potentially be removed due to excessive missingness.

4. Data Cleaning and Imputation Strategy

Different imputation strategies were applied based on the data type and statistical properties of the features. For numerical features, median imputation was used, as it is robust to outliers commonly present in housing price data. For categorical features, mode imputation was applied to preserve the most frequently occurring category and maintain data consistency.

Columns with an extremely high percentage of missing values were removed to avoid introducing noise and bias into the dataset. This step ensured that only informative and reliable features were retained for further analysis.

5. Data Validation and Quality Assessment

After applying the cleaning steps, the dataset was revalidated to confirm that all missing values were handled successfully. The final dataset contained no null values and maintained a consistent structure suitable for downstream tasks. The overall data quality improved significantly, reducing the risk of biased results and improving model performance potential.

6. Conclusion

This analysis highlights the importance of effective data cleaning and missing value handling in housing price prediction tasks. By systematically identifying missing values, applying appropriate imputation techniques, and validating the cleaned dataset, the data was transformed into a reliable and machine-learning-ready format. The cleaned House Prices Dataset can now be confidently used for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
